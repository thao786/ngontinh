Dickens famous opening sentence introduces the universal nature of the book and the drama depicted within:

    It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.[3]

The story's narrative begins with Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Lucie Manette traveling to Saint Antoine, a suburb of Paris, to meet Monsieur Defarge and Madame Defarge. The Defarges operate a wine shop which they use to lead a clandestine band of revolutionaries; they refer to each other by the codename "Jacques," which Dickens drew from the Jacobins, an actual French revolutionary group.
